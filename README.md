# covid-19-tracker

This application allows users to see global data as well as data pertaining to specific countries including the total population, deaths caused by covid-19,
the number of confirmed cases, and the number recovered. Upon the page loading, the user will see the global data as default and from the dropdown menu can 
select a different country.

The API used for this project is https://covid-api.mmediagroup.fr/v1

In the future, I would like to incorporate different ways to visualize the data, possibly with different graphs and charts using chart.js
